# Karabiner Configs

## Karabiner Hyperkeys
- Setup Karabiner for Hyperkey
    - Setting hyperkey to `capslock` for ergonomic purposes

### First Layers for  
    - setting hyperkey + q to be the `ctrl` key
    - setting hyperkey to behave as `escape` key when only hyperkey is activated
    - setting up most used apps specific keybinds for quick openings

### Creating Sub Layers
    - Sub Layers are for system commands, and apps that are not used as often or
    etc.
#### Example
    - set hyperkey + a letter for main commands
    - then set another letter for the command to run any action

- Sublayers hyper keys are mainly used to control
    - opening applications
    - system commands like sounds, music & window management via raycast + rectangle
    - global vim motions
    - other raycast available deep links extensions. 

> [!NOTE]
> Sublayer keybinds should not overlap with the First layers
> - If so, it defaults to the First Layers keybinds
